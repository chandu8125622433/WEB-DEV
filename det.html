            <H3>In <mark>July 1942</mark>  , a Service Commission with a chairman and two members was established to recruit subordinate staff on the North Western Railway.</H3>  
                <H3>In 1945, additional Service Commissions were set up in Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, and Lucknow, tasked with recruiting Class III staff and advising General Managers on appeals related to disciplinary matters.</H3>    
                 <H3> In <MARk>1948</MARk> , the Indian Railway Enquiry Committee recommended making these commissions permanent while withdrawing their role in appeals to focus solely on recruitment.</H3>
